# Image Thresholding

Thresholding is a simple yet effective method for image segmentation and creating binary images.

## How it Works
The filter converts an image to black and white by setting pixels above a certain threshold value to white and below it to black.

## Parameters
- **Threshold Value**: The cutoff point between black and white (0-255)
- **Method**: Type of thresholding (Binary, Otsu, Adaptive)
- **Max Value**: The value to set for pixels above threshold

## Use Cases
- Document scanning
- Text extraction
- Object segmentation
- Creating masks
- Simplifying complex images
