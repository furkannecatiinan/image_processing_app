# Edge Detection

Edge detection is a fundamental image processing technique that identifies boundaries of objects within an image.

## How it Works
The filter works by detecting areas in the image where the brightness changes rapidly. It uses various operators (like Sobel or Canny) to identify these changes and mark them as edges.

## Parameters
- **Method**: Choice of edge detection algorithm (Sobel, Canny)
- **Threshold**: Determines the sensitivity of edge detection
- **Blur**: Amount of pre-processing blur to reduce noise

## Use Cases
- Object boundary detection
- Feature extraction
- Image segmentation
- Pattern recognition
- Computer vision applications
